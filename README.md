# Password-Generator-

Details: the meaning of this is to generate a password that contains a certain number of charachters & type of charachters generate as a password based on the users response


- created an addEventListener to generate my button with my first variable prompt asking how many charachters the user would want the password to be 

- created a while loop in order to provide a bases for how long the password length can be 

- created confirm variables that the user can either confirm or cancel 

- added a while loop to have the user at least choose one of the special charachters for password 

- created a function to generate the new password on the page with for loops to go through each of my charachters of each variable (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, numbers)


Overall: this one was difficult trying to remember how to connect and name functions to not scramble things. It doesnt seem like i was able to get the random password, though my logic seems to be in the right area. I had my 'if' functions allow the password to go through each of the charachters in my strings. I got stuck trying to figure out how to connect the if functions to scramble the charachters based on user choice to show up in the generator. it showed up : undefined. I will be working on this more in the future and maybe even add some more things to make it more interesting, but for now this is as far as i seem to have been able to go.
